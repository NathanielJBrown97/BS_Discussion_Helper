# Brightspace Discussion Board Helper Tool
As a teaching assistant at the University of Rhode Island, I spend a lot of time grading students weekly submissions. One of these weekly tasks is reading students responses to weekly prompts and evaluating each submission on specific criteria. As the prompts are the same for every student; answers are naturally similar. Using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods these discussions can be evaluated automatically and save the individual in charge of grading 1-2 hours of their day!
