# BS_Discussion_Helper
This is a personal project designed to improve the quality of life of the instructor in charge of reading 40+ student's original discussion posts each week, as well as their required responses. This project will feature a scrape/crawl method to fill a CSV of student's weekly responses, and then auto-grader modules to evaluate the students weekly.
